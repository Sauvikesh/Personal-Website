                This is a project that I built in my Object-Oriented Programming class with a friend. 
                Its simple 2 player battleship but all in the terminal. It also has the option to be played with 1 or 2 AIs, and each AI
                has 3 difficulties. We utilized polymorphism to reduce the amount of code needed for the different AI difficulties.

            <h3 class="description">
                I wanted to take a shot at creating a slightly more advanced game in C++, so I went with snake. The difference between
                this version and the traditional version of snake is that the snake moves one at a time with user input instead of
                moving forward constantly. In addition, the number of rows and columns of the game board can be adjusted 
                using command line arguments.

            <h3 class="description">
                When I was first learning C, I decided to create tic tac toe as a way to get familiar with the syntax of the language.
                I print out a 3x3 game board to the terminal during each player's turn and ask them to pick a spot to put their symbol 
                using a row and column number pair. If the user typed in something invalid, the program would simply ask the user again
                for input.

                This is another class projected that I worked on with a friend. Its a recreation of the game connect 4 in C, but you
                are able to adjust the number of rows, columns, and the amount you need to match in a row to win using command line
                arguments.
